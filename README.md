# Set-Counter
A simple application that lets you tally a score, like in competitive matches

Also features an option to save and load scores at any time, as well as a blank folder to place these in
I first created this to help me with (surprise surprise) competitive pokemon and understand how I'm doing into
certain matchups and laddering sessions. I figured that since I can't find similar projects online that I'd
make one myself, so here we are!

If you run into any problems, please let me know and I'll try to fix them
